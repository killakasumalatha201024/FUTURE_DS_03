# 🎓 College Event Feedback Analysis – Internship Project
**Data Science & Analytics Task 3 | By Future Interns**

---

### 🔹 Project Overview
Analyze student feedback from college events (tech fests, workshops, cultural activities) to uncover satisfaction trends and suggest improvements using data science.  

- Use both **rating-based** and **text-based** feedback  
- Apply **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for sentiment analysis  
- Turn survey data into actionable insights  

---

### 🔹 What You’ll Do
- ✅ Clean and prepare feedback data (CSV from Google Forms)  
- ✅ Analyze ratings (1–5 scale) to identify satisfaction patterns  
- ✅ Use NLP tools (TextBlob / VADER) to classify comments as Positive, Negative, or Neutral  
- ✅ Visualize trends with bar charts, pie charts, and word clouds  
- ✅ Suggest improvements for future events  

---

### 🔹 Skills Gained
- 🧠 Data cleaning & preparation with **pandas**  
- 📊 Sentiment analysis using **TextBlob / VADER**  
- 📈 Data visualization with **seaborn / matplotlib**  
- 💡 Interpreting survey data to generate actionable recommendations  
- 💻 Working in **Google Colab**
